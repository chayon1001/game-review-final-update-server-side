## CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are essential for managing data in most web applications. Here's an overview of how you can implement CRUD operations in your website:

1. Create
    - Purpose: Add new data to the database, such as reviews, user profiles, or game records.
    - Implementation:
    Use an HTML form or modal to collect data from users.
    Send a POST request to the server API endpoint.

2.  Read
    - Purpose: Fetch and display data from the server, such as all reviews or a specific user's details.

    - Implementation:
    Use GET requests to retrieve data.


3. Update

    - Purpose: Modify existing data in the database, such as updating a review or user profile.

     - Implementation:
    Use a PUT or PATCH request.
    Include the item's unique identifier (_id or id) in the URL or request body.



4. Delete

    - Purpose: Remove specific data from the database.

    - Implementation:
    Use a DELETE request.
    Include the item's unique identifier in the URL.


5. Integrate with Backend
    - Use a Node.js/Express server (or similar) to handle API routes.
